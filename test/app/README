This directory contains a few sample programs to demonstrante
a dummy message exchange of the Traffic Steering use case.
These programs are simple and in most of the cases error
checking is not performed to keep them simple.

ad_xapp.cpp
    Simulates the AD xApp sending an Anomaly Message to the
    TS xApp. It sends one message, receives its corresponding
    ACK, and exits. All steps are logged in the console. Uses
    RMR port 4570.

qp_xapp.cpp
    Simulates both, the QoE Prediction (QP), and the QP Driver xApps.
    Basically, this program receives Prediction Requests from TS xApp,
    computes random throughput values (predictions) for neighbor cells,
    and sends that Throughput Prediction to the TS xApp. All steps are
    logged in the console. Uses RMR port 4580.

echo-server.py
    Implements a dummy echo server just for testing REST calls from
    TS xApp.

routes.rt
    Contains a few RMR routing policies to allow AD, QP, and TS xApps
    exchange messages in this controlled environment.
